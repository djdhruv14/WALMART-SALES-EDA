The main goal of this project is to obtain insight into Walmart's sales data in order to comprehend the various factors that influence sales at various branches.
This dataset contains sales transactions 
from  three different branches of Walmart, respectively located in Mandalay, Yangon and Naypyitaw. The data contains 17 columns and 1000 rows.
The company might want to consider increasing marketing efforts for the lower-selling product lines like health and beauty to boost their sales or understand why they are underperforming. 
There could be an opportunity to review the pricing strategy. If electronic accessories are selling well, is it because they are priced competitively? Or could the company afford to increase prices without hurting sales? Conversely, are the health and beauty products priced too high, resulting in lower quantities sold?
